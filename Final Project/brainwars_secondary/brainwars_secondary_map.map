WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net note_decoder/_n0106<0> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 2,054 out of   2,278   90%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       160 out of   4,556    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        7,397
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         4,696 out of   7,397   63%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             173 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
